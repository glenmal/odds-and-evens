Odds and Evens Rules:

This is a 2 player game, and starts by one player deciding if they want to be odds or evens. 
Both players then simultaneously show any number of fingers from one hand (0 to 5). 
If the sum of the fingers shown by both players is even, then the player who was designation evens wins that round. 
If itâ€™s odd the player who was designated odds wins. 
Players can play multiple rounds to determine an overall winner just like in Rock, Paper and Scissors (Best of n, First to n).
